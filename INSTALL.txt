libxml2 < 2.6.27 
----------------

libxml2 releases older than 2.6.27 contain a bug preventing the ProActive Linux
Agent to parse its XSD Schema. The agent uses lxml which rely on libxml2 to
parse XML and XSD files. Some distributions like RHEL/Centos 5 still ship 
a broken libxml2 package. 

If the following eror is encoutered a newer libxml2 release must be used:

	Unable to load XML Schema palinagent/daemon/xsd/1.0/agent-linux.xsd: 
	complex type 'ConfMemoryLimitationType': The content type must specify 
	a particle., line 85 (please check your installlation). 

A script to automatically build libxml2, libxslt and lxml is provided with the 
agent. It installs the python package and the shared libraries into its 
directory. Please note that some package like gcc, zlib-devel, python-devel, 
libtool, etc. must be installed.

	$ ./build_lxml
        
To use the newer lxml package the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH environment 
variable must be adjusted. This is automatically done by the fix_lxml wrapper

	$ ./fix_lxml ./proactive-agent config.xml
